## Syllabus
1. **Introduction (Oct 2, [slides](/01s-intro/), [assignments](https://github.com/ohm-softa/01-tools/))**
	
	We'll talk about software architecture, abstraction, decomposition and good software design.
	We'll also review the tools and ressources that you'll need for this class.

2. **Classes and Interfaces revisited (Oct 2, [slides](/02s-classes-interfaces/), [lecture notes](/02ln-classes-interfaces/), [assignments](https://github.com/ohm-softa/02-classes-interfaces/))**
	
	We look at different types of classes (inner, anonymous, local, static), when to use them, and which visibility for which purpose.
	Also: `@FunctionalInterface` and lambda expressions.

3. **Inheritance revisited (Oct 9, [slides](/03s-inheritance/), [lecture notes](/03ln-inheritance/), [assignments](https://github.com/ohm-softa/03-inheritance))**
	
	We talk about abstract and final classes, (pure) virtual functions and defaults.
	Also, when (and how) to use abstract base classes, and how the Decorator pattern can be used to add functionality to existing classes.

4. **Mixins, pt. 1; Generics, pt. 1 (Oct 16, [slides](/04s-generics-1/), [lecture notes](/04ln-generics-1/), [assignments](https://github.com/ohm-softa/04-generics))**
	
	After a short digression to Mixins, we dig into the details of how generics work in Java, and how to apply them to data structures and algorithms.

5. **Mixins, pt. 2; Generics, pt. 2 (Oct 23, [slides](/05s-generics-2/), [lecture notes](/05ln-generics-2/), [assignments](https://github.com/ohm-softa/05-generics-bounds))**
	
	We'll review Mixins and see how to use generics to make them stateful.
	Generics and inheritance need special attention, and will lead us to bounds and wildcards.

6. **Reflection and Annotations (Oct 30, [slides](/06s-reflection-annotations/), [lecture notes](/06ln-reflection-annotations/), [assignments](https://github.com/ohm-softa/06-annotations-reflection))**
	
	Learn how reflection works in Java, and how they enable annotations by using examples of testing ([JUnit5](http://junit.org/junit5/)), serialization ([gson](https://github.com/google/gson)) and networking ([retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit)).

7. **Design patterns, pt. 1 (Nov 6, [slides](/07s-iterator-composite-observer/), [lecture notes](/07ln-iterator-composite-observer/), assignments: [JavaFX (recommended)](https://github.com/ohm-softa/07-composite-observer-jfx) or [Android (advanced)](https://github.com/ohm-softa/07-composite-observer-android))**

	We begin with a few basic patterns: composite, iterator and observer, and use that to dive into Android and MVC/MVVC.

8. **Design patterns, pt. 2 (Nov 13, [slides](/08s-singleton-factory-strategy-command/), [lecture notes](/08ln-singleton-factory-strategy-command/), assignments: [JavaFX](https://github.com/ohm-softa/08-singleton-factory-strategy-jfx) or [Android](https://github.com/ohm-softa/08-singleton-factory-strategy-android))**

	We look at more every-day-patterns: singleton, factory, strategy and command.

9. **Design patterns, pt. 3 (Nov 20, [slides](/09s-proxy-adapter-flyweight/), [lecture notes](/09ln-proxy-adapter-flyweight/), assignments: [JavaFX](https://github.com/ohm-softa/09-adapter-flyweight-jfx), [Android](https://github.com/ohm-softa/09-adapter-flyweight-android))**
	
	We round up a few more useful patterns: proxy and adapter to make other peoples' modules fit your needs, and flyweight to save on precious memory in (mostly) graphical apps.

10. **Parallel processing (Nov 27, [slides](/10s-threads/), [lecture notes](/10ln-threads/), assignments: [JavaFX](https://github.com/ohm-softa/10-threads-jfx), [Android](https://github.com/ohm-softa/10-threads-android))**

	Because sometimes, you need to work on more than one thing at a time!
	We'll look at threads and how to control and synchronize them.

11. **Asynchronous programming (Dec 4, [slides](/11s-futures/), [lecture notes](/11ln-futures/), assignments: [CLI](https://github.com/ohm-softa/11-futures-cli), [Android](https://github.com/ohm-softa/11-futures-android))**

	User interfaces often require us to work not only in parallel, but to do so in an asynchronous way.
	Learn about a better `Future` for asynchronous or concurrent workloads, and what _promise chaining_ can do for you.

12. **Introduction to functional programming (Dec 11, [slides](/12s-fp1/), [lecture notes](/12ln-fp1/), [assignments](https://github.com/ohm-softa/12-functional-cli))**
	
	Leave your imperative and objected oriented programming comfort zone and follow me down the rabbit hole of functional programming.
	After some theory, we'll do some basic exercises, including `filter`, `map` and `forEach`.

13. **Functional programming in Java (Dec 18, [slides](/13s-fp2/), [lecture notes](/13ln-fp2/), [assignments](https://github.com/ohm-softa/13-map-reduce-collect))**

	We'll talk about the specifics (and limits) of functional programming in Java.
	Learn about the classes and interfaces used for Java's functional parts, and the more sophisticated stream reduction using `reduce` and `collect`.

	> Winter break Dec 23 through Jan 6.

14. **Patterns of modern software architecture (Jan 8, [slides](/15s-patterns-of-modern-software-architecture/))**
	
	We're wrapping up the semester by talking about patterns of modern software architecture, such as 	dependency injection or microservices.

15. **Guest Lecture: Agile Architektur (Jan 15)**

	We'll have a Q&A session at 1.30p at the lecture hall, followed by an invited talk presented by Werner Eberling, MATHEMA Software GmbH at 3.45p.
