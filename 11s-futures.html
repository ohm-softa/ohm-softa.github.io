# Parallel Processing

## Futures

Korbinian Riedhammer

---

# Threads

```java
Thread t = new Thread(new Runnable() {
	@Override
	public void run() {
		System.out.println("Hello from my custom thread!");
	}
});

t.start();
System.out.println("Hello from the application main thread!")

System.out.println("Waiting for thread to complete...");
t.join();

System.out.println("All done.");
```

---

# Futures, Callables, Executor

```java
interface Callable<V> {
	V call();
}
```

```java
interface Future<T> {
	T get();
	// ...
}
```

```java
interface ExecutorService {
	void execute(Runnable command);
	<T> Future<T> submit(Callable<T> task);
	// ...
}
```

`ExecutorService`s provided by Java:

```java
Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
Executors.newCachedThreadPool();  // reuses threads
Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);  // use 5 threads
```

---

# Chaining with CompletableFuture

```java
class CompletableFuture<T> implements CompletionStage<T>, Future<T> {
	static <U> CompletableFuture<U> supplyAsync(Supplier<U> supplier) { 
		// ...
	}
	<U> CompletionStage<U> thenApplyAsync(Function<? super T, ? extends U> fn) {
		// ...
	}
	<U> CompletionStage<U> thenAcceptAsync(Consumer<? super T> action) { 
		// ...
	}
	CompletableFuture<T> exceptionally(Function<Throwable, ? extends T> fn) {
		// ...
	}
	// and much more...
}
```

---

# Chaining with CompletableFuture

```java
CompletableFuture<?> cf = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "riko493:12345")
	.thenApplyAsync(creds -> {
		System.out.println("Authenticating with " + creds);
		return "secrettoken";
	})
	.thenApplyAsync(token -> {
		System.out.println("Retrieving status with token=" + token);
		return "in the mood for holidays";
	})
	.thenAccept(status -> System.out.println(status))
	.exceptionally(ex -> { System.out.println("Oops, something went wrong: " + ex); return null; });

System.out.println("All done!");
```

# Summary (1)

Use threads to run code asynchronously and in parallel.

- _asynchronously_ means the caller/delegator immediately continues execution after queueing the task
- _parallel_ means that more than one method is executed at the same time; asynchronous methods are typcially executed in parallel.
- use `join` to wait on threads to complete

Be extra careful when threads _share resources_.

- use thread-safe containers
- protect critical sections with `synchronized`
- minimize blocking time and avoid deadlocks with inter-thread communication (`wait`, `yield`, `notify`, `notifyAll`)

---

# Summary (2)

Use `Future` to retrieve results and handle exceptions within the threads.

- `get()` will block until the thread has completed (and raise possible exception)
- `cancel()` terminates the execution of the task
- `isDone()` returns `true` if the task completed

Use `CompletableFuture` for elegant asynchronous programming.

- use `supplyAsync` to create a chainable `CompletableFuture`
- use `thenApplyAsync` to transform intermediate results
- use `thenAcceptAsyc` to consume final results (end of chain!)
- use `thenCombineAsync` to join multiple `CompletableFuture`

Use `ExecutorService`s when batch-processing large quantities of data, e.g. importing multiple files, scaling images, downloading resources, etc.
