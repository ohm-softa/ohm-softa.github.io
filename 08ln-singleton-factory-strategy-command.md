# Design Patterns, pt. 2

This week we'll talk about two structural patterns (_Singleton_ and _Factory_) as well as two behavioral patterns (_Strategy_ and _Command_).

# Singleton

The task at hand is pretty simple: How can you ensure that a certain object is unique among your application?

In Java, there are a number of ways to realize that.
First, lets start with the obvious: we need to control who is allowed to create instances.
The safest thing to do is to make the constructor _private_.
If we can only create instances _from within the class_, we can allocate a static attribute at startup.

```java
class Singleton {
	public static final Singleton instance = new Singleton();

	private Singleton() {

	}
}
```
```java
Singleton.instance.doSomething();
```

This works if the constructor is trivial, and no further setup of `instance` is required.
But what if you need to do some extra work for `instance` to be ready-to-use?
The answer is: use a _static initializer block_.

And one more thing: the public visibility does not allow to guard the instance, e.g. from simultaneous access from multiple threads.
To fix this, use a getter method.

```java
class Singleton {
	private final static Singleton instance;

	static {
		instance = new Singleton();

		// do more work...
	}

	private Singleton() {

	}

	public static Singleton getInstance() {
		// guard if necessary...
		return instance;
	}
}
```
```java
Singleton.getInstance().doSomething();
```

The drawback of this solution is that the singleton is now instantiated at startup, and regardless if it is actually used.
To fix this, use a lazy initializer:

```java
class Singleton {
	private static Singleton instance;  // note: no final!

	public static Singleton getInstance() {
		if (instance == null) {
			instance = new Singleton();

			// do more stuff...
		}

		return instance;
	}

	private Singleton() {

	}
}
```
```java
Singleton.getInstance().doSomething();
```

All of these methods can be fooled using reflection.
If you truly want to disable further instantiation, use an `enum`, as described in [Bloch's Effective Java](https://www.amazon.de/Effective-Java-Edition-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683).

```java
enum Singleton {
	INSTANCE;

	// specify more attributes, e.g. a counter
	int counter = 0;

	public int nextInt() {
		return counter++;
	}
}
```
```java
System.out.println(Singleton.INSTANCE.nextInt());  // "0"
System.out.println(Singleton.INSTANCE.nextInt());  // "1"
System.out.println(Singleton.INSTANCE.nextInt());  // "2"
```

Why woud you do this? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

No seriously.
It has to do with serialization: attributes of enums are not serialized (which can be a good or bad thing, it depends).
Most developers opt for the _lazy initialization_ method, since it makes the initialization more controllable.


## Structure and Participants

![dp-singleton](/assets/dp-singleton.svg)

- `Singleton`
	+ typically responsible for managing its unique instance
	+ provides operation to obtain unique instance (in Java: `static` method)


## Discussion

Singletons are standard practice to avoid resource conflicts or overallocation.
However, they are at the same time (strongly) discouraged if working in a multi-threaded (parallel) environment: while the actual resource conflict can be (usually) solved with locking, the process itself may dramatically reduce the benefit of parallel processing.

For advanced developers: Favor [_dependency injection_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) over singletons.


## Examples

- Logging facilities
- Event busses and dispatch queues
- Device handles (there is only 1 physical device, e.g. `System.out`)
- Service objects (eg. API wrappers, ...)

# Strategy

# A Basic Example

The _strategy_ pattern helps to abstract a certain method from its actual implementation.
It is so fundamental to Java that it has the syntax keyword `interface` to separate _declarations_ from _implementations_.

Let's consider a simple example, where we want to sort a list in ascending or descending order, using different `Comparator<T>`s.

```java
List<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>();
list.add(4);
list.add(7);
list.add(1);
list.add(1);

Collections.sort(list, new Comparator<Integer>() {
	@Override
	public compare(Integer a, Integer b) {
		return a.compareTo(b);
	}
});

Collections.sort(list, new Comparator<Integer>() {
	@Override
	public compare(Integer a, Integer b) {
		return b.compareTo(a);  // note the flipped order!
	}
});
```

# A More Sophisticated Example

Check out [JavaKara](https://www.swisseduc.ch/informatik/karatojava/javakara/), a little robot bug that can be moved through a tiny world.

![kara-explore](/assets/kara-explore.png)

You can control it with very basic actions:

```java
public class Kara extends JavaKaraProgram {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		Kara k = new Kara();
		k.run("src/main/resources/world2.world");
	}

	@Override
	public void myMainProgram() {
		kara.move();        // one step forward
		kara.turnLeft();    // you guessed it...
		kara.turnRight();
		kara.treeFront();   // tree ahead?
		kara.putLeaf();     // take a clover leaf
		kara.removeLeav();  // remove a clover leaf		
	}
}
```

To have kara explore the whole room (starting from the center), you could think of two _strategies_:
- walk concentric growing circles until the room is fully explored
- walk to the top-right corner; then sweep left-to-right, top-to-bottom.

The sample code can be found in <https://github.com/ohm-softa/ohm-softa.github.io/tree/master/examples/src/main/java/designpattern/strategy>.
Check out the `StrategyExampleBad`, which has two explicit plans, `planA()` and `planB()`.
Contrast it with the implementation in `StrategyExample`: here, the logic of the strategy is moved to a separate class which is instantiated as needed.

## Discussion

The strategy pattern often shows up "in disguise."
For example, the `Stream.filter(Predicate<T> p)`, `Iterable.iterator()` or `Collection.sort(Comparator<T> c)` are all flavors of the strategy pattern: they allow to do the same thing in different ways.

You can easily spot potential refactoring areas if you have code such as

```java
if (isWav())
	return decodeWav(data);
else if (isMP3())
	return decodeMP3(data);
else
	return data.raw;
```

with the `decode{Wav,MP3}()` methods being members of the class.
Refactor to the strategy pattern by extracting them from the class and use them via a common interface.


## Examples

- `Comparator` interface, to customize sorting
- Encryption and authentication protocols
- Media encoders (mp3, mp4, aac, etc.)
- Serializers ("save as..." feature)

# Factory

A factory provides instances that fulfill a certain interface.

## A Basic Example

Let's consider a basic example: a package with public interfaces but package-private classes.

```java
package mypackage;

public interface Klass {
	void method();
}
```
```java
package mypackage;

class KlassImpl implements Klass {
	public void method() {
		System.out.println("Hello World!");
	}
}
```

So from outside the package, you can't instantiate `KlassImpl`:

```java
package someApp;
class MyApp {
	public static void main(String... args) {
		mypackage.Klass k = new mypackage.KlassImpl();  // not visible!
	}
}
```

This is where you need a factory method, often attached to an abstract class or as a static method to an interface.

```java
package mypackage;

public interface Klass {
	void method();
	static Klass create() {
		return new KlassImpl();  // inside package: visible!
	}
}
```
```java
mypackage.Klass k = mypackage.Klass.create();
```

As you can see, the _user_ of the package relies on the interface, and has no idea on which class was actually instantiated.


## A More Sophisticated Example: Factory and Strategy

Recall last week's [composite pattern](/07ln-iterator-composite-observer/) which can be found for example in the implementation of JSON or an XML tree.
In principal, both can store key-value relations, potentially nested:

```json
{
	"key": "value",
	"nested": {
		"key": "value"
	}
}
```
```xml
<element>
	<key>value</key>
	<element>
		<key>value</key>
	</element>
</element>
```

```java
interface Component {
	String toString();
}
interface Composite extends Component {
	void add(Component c);
}
interface Leaf extends Component {
}
```

With realizations for Json (`JsonComponent`, `JsonComposite`, `JsonLeaf`) and XML (`XmlComponent`, ...) that model similar structure, but different `toString()` serialization.

Without a factory, you would have to manually construct the composite:

```java
JsonComposite root = new JsonComposite("root");
root.add(new JsonLeaf("key", "value"));
Composite nested = new JsonComposite("nested");
nested.add(new JsonLeaf("key", "value"));
root.add(nested);
System.out.println(root);  // "root": {"key": "value", "nested": {"key": "value"}}
```

And similarly for `XmlComposite`.
If you abstract the instance creation into a factory, you could generalize the code significantly:

```java
interface CompositeFactory {
	Composite createComposite(String name);
	Leaf createLeaf(String name, String value);
}
```
```java
class JsonFactory implements CompositeFactory {
	@Override
	public Composite createComposite(String name) {
		return new JsonComposite(name);
	}

	@Override
	public Leaf createLeaf(String name, String value) {
		return new JsonLeaf(name, value);
	}
}
```

```java
CompositeFactory f = new JsonFactory();
// CompositeFactory f = new XmlFactory();

Composite root = f.createComposite("root");
root.add(f.createLeaf("key", "value"));

Composite nested = f.createComposite("nested");
nested.add(f.createLeaf("key", "value"));

root.add(nested);

System.out.println(root);
```

As you can see, you only need to replace the factory that produces the concrete classes; the construction logic remains the same.

You can find the above example code at <https://github.com/hsro-inf-prg3/hsro-inf-prg3.github.io/tree/master/examples/src/main/java/designpattern/factory>.


## Structure and Participants

![dp-factory](/assets/dp-abstract-factory.svg)

- `AbstractFactory`
	+ declares interface for operations that create the abstract products
- `ConcreteFactory`
	+ _implements_ the operations and procudes concrete products
- `AbstractProduct`
	+ declares interface for operations
- `ConcreteProduct`
	+ _implements_ the operations
- `Client`
	+ uses only interfaces declared by `AbstractFactory` and `AbstractProduct`


## Discussion

The factory pattern is omnipresent; sometimes it is realized as a single _factory method_, sometimes as a larger factory serving different objects.

The most common use is when developing against interfaces where the implementing classes are package-private.
The package would then expose a _factory_ that allows to generate instances that implement the public interfaces -- with internals hidden from the client.


## Examples

Typically objects that are either complicated to instantiate or which should not be exposed outside of a package.

- Iterators (probably the most frequently used factory)
- Objects that have complex instantiation protocols
- Logging instances
- API wrappers

# Command

Let's get back to kara for a moment.
We could write a program that takes input from the command line and uses that to direct kara around.

![kara-explore-2](/assets/kara-explore-2.png)

```java
public class InteractiveKara extends JavaKaraProgram {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		InteractiveKara program = new InteractiveKara();
		program.run("src/main/resources/world1.world");

		int c;
		while ((c = System.in.read()) != -1) {
			if (c == 10)
				continue;  // enter
			else if ((char) c == 'e')
				break;

			try {
				switch ((char) c) {
					case 'm': program.kara.move(); break;
					case 'l': program.kara.turnLeft(); break;
					case 'r': program.kara.turnRight(); break;
					case 't': program.kara.removeLeaf(); break;
					case 'd': program.kara.putLeaf(); break;
				}
			} catch (RuntimeException e) {
				System.out.println(e);
				System.exit(0);
			}
		}

		System.exit(0);
	}
}
```

Note the `catch` for `RuntimeException`: this happens if you have kara walk into a tree, or try to pick up a leaf where there is none.

So here is the problem: The above program works nicely until we hit a tree or otherwise raise an exception, at which point the while application is terminated.

Can you think of a mechanism that instead allows us to back-track where we came from?
Or in other words: if we screw up, can we undo the previous moves?

We can, if we take care of the following aspects:
- for every action, we need to know the reverse
- we need to keep track of every successful action
- (optionally) we can manually "forget" our history, if we're at a good place.

These are covered by the command pattern.
Instead of directly calling the actions on kara, we make _objects_ that will do the actual work:

```java
interface Command {
	void execute();
	default void undo() {
		throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
	}
}
```

Now, if we keep a journal (stack) of commands, it is easy to go back: just remove them one-by-one and call `.undo()`.

Here is an example for a command to move forward:

```java
class MoveCommand implements Command {
	private JavaKaraProgram.JavaKara kara;
	public MoveCommand(JavaKaraProgram.JavaKara kara) {
		this.kara = kara;
	}

	@Override
	public void execute() {
		kara.move();
	}

	@Override
	public void undo() {
		// turn back, move
		new TurnCommand(kara, 2).execute();
		kara.move();

		// turn to original direction
		new TurnCommand(kara, 2).execute();
	}
}
```

Let's alter the main program to use the command pattern:

```java
public class CommandExample extends JavaKaraProgram {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		CommandExample program = new CommandExample();
		program.run("src/main/resources/world1.world");

		// this will keep track of the successful commands
		Stack<Command> history = new Stack<>();

		int c;
		while ((c = System.in.read()) != -1) {
			// ...

			Command cmd = new IdleCommand();
			switch ((char) c) {
				case 'm': cmd = new MoveCommand(program.kara); break;
				case 'l': cmd = new TurnCommand(program.kara, -1); break;
				// ...
			}

			try {
				cmd.execute();
				history.push(cmd);
			} catch (RuntimeException e) {
				System.out.println(e);
				System.out.println("Tracking back to last saved state");
				// go back to beginning, restart
				while (history.size() > 0)
					history.pop().undo();
			}
		}

		System.exit(0);
	}
}
```

## Structure and Participants

![dp-command](/assets/dp-command.svg)

- `Command`
	+ declares an interface for executing an operation
- `ConcreteCommand`
	+ _implements_ the operation
	+ uses the receiver as needed
- `Client` (application)
	+ creates `ConcreteCommand` and hands receiver
- `Invoker`
	+ actually calls `.execute()`
- `Receiver`
	+ the object used by the strategy


## Discussion

The command pattern is more frequent than you might initially think.
Think of it this way: whenever you allow the user to sequentially apply certain commands to your data/state, you may want to be able to undo those at some point.
Building up a stack of actions automatically leads to adopting the command pattern.


## Examples

- Editors that support undo or macros
- Databases with transaction/rollback support
- Filesystems with journaling
- Version control (eg. git)
- Realizations of automatons
